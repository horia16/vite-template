# Vite Modular Template

This is yet another opinionated Vite template that aims to help developers with creating Vue applications.

## The how and why

This template was originally created for personal projects and is heavily inspired by the another popular template called [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse).

This template is designed using a modular approach for splitting large applications into smaller self-contained parts resulting in a lot less clutter and easier readability.
